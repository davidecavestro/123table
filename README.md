# 123Table


## Motivation

Beyond the obvious need to load rows into a db table, this project began
to experiment with the feasibility and limitations - in 2025 - of using only
Groovy scripts, a Dockerfile and some bash as a minimalist approach to
developing a small CLI tool with some automated test coverage without the
bells and whistles of build tools.
